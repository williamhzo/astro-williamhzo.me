## the tools

Personal website and blog built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

Styles are handled with pure CSS and are based on [Andy Bell](https://andy-bell.co.uk/)'s [CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi/) methodology with [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev/) approach (also written by Andy, along with [Heydon Pickering](https://heydonworks.com/)). This makes way for robust, scalable and organised stylesheets, using the cascade (one of the "C"s in "CSS").

The philosophy behind is summed up in [buildexcellentwebsit.es](https://buildexcellentwebsit.es/).
