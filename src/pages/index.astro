      <h3>Crafting user-focused interfaces</h3>

      <p>
        I design & build with accessibility and progressive enhancement as a
        baseline to guarantee end-user gets the best possible experience â€”
        regardless of device, network quality, disability or preference.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mindful of shipping as little client-side JavaScript as possible, I
        strongly believe in under-engineering and using the right tool for the
        job, being for styles or fetching & displaying dynamic data.
