      <h1>About me</h1>

      <p>
        Hey, I'm William <Emoji emoji="ðŸ‘‹" label="waving hand" />
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm a freelance Frontend & UI Engineer from the South-West of France,
        currently based in Porto.
      </p>

      <p>
        Welcome to my small space of the internet, where I showcase my work,
        learnings and anything else I want to show to the world.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before building websites I worked in various roles in the frame of my
        Mechanical Engineering Degree: Construction Site Manager, Logistics
        Consultant and Mechanical Testing Engineer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Eventually I tought myself how to code and deep-dived in Frontend
        development to follow my passion. Having worked for 2 years as a first
        Frontend Engineer then Lead Frontend in a SaaS Fintech, I developed
        great affinity towards UI Engineering, UI design, UX and Design Systems.
        I am driven by being the <a
          href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-product-minded-engineer/"
          >Product-Minded Engineer</a
        > on the team.
      </p>

      <p>
        Deeply passionate about clean user interfaces and painting on the
        internet, I find inspiration and resources in a broad range of fields
        and art. I'm trying to be more mindful of my time, to deliver quality
        work while remaining productive.

      <h2>This website</h2>

      <p>
        This site has no ads, tracking, analytics, sponsors or affiliation, and
        will never have. I want to contribute to making the web a better place
        as I believe in a <em>genuine</em>, <em>inclusive</em>, <em>fun</em> and
        <em>open</em> internet.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's a static website built with <a href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a
        >, vanilla CSS and is hosted on <a href="https://vercel.com">Vercel</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Building it without a specific Frontend framework or a fancy CSS library
        was a bowl of fresh air in these times where shipping massive bundles of
        JavaScript to the browser is often the default.
      </p>

      <p>
        For styling, I followed <a href="https://andy-bell.co.uk/">Andy Bell</a
        >'s methodology called <a href="https://cube.fyi/">CubeCSS</a> â€” which is
        a way to organise stylesheets in a scalable and maintainable manner â€” along
        with some wisdom from his talk <a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uhIiI9Ld5M"
          >Be the browser's mentor, not his micromanager</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some styles are based on Andy's and <a href="https://heydonworks.com/"
          >Heydon</a
        >'s <a href="https://every-layout.dev/">Every Layout</a>, which is a
        great ressource deep-diving into common layout patterns and their
        implementation with modern CSS (with progressive enhancement in mind).
